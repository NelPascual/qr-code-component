### What I learned

In this project I continued practicing the use of object positioning, border-radius and text formatting.

### Continued development

This is my fifth project done on this platform, I will continue to apply what I have learned in the following projects, taking advantage of each of the challenges, as each of them always challenges us to learn something new and correct mistakes made in previous projects.

## Acknowledgments

I thank Frontend Mentor for providing free resources to put into practice what I have learned, and above all a place to show them.
